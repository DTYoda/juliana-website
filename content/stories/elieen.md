did not say _lawyer._ She said _attorney,_ and even more often, _litigator,_

a word I could not have defined precisely. 

It reminded me of _alligator_. Her father, an alligator.

I didn’t know that from this word grew another she loved: _litigious,_ 

which meant nothing to me, but rhymed with _religious._

_Even in private, he is very litigious,_ she said, and I imagined him at prayer.

All day at school, I imagined presenting my head to an alligator.

I pictured him devouring it. And Jane said, one day, I would think about this
