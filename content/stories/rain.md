“Fucking Hell-” 

We both watched as the television flickered and faded to black. Maze grumbled, his gaze filled with annoyance and anger. 

“Hey….dude, it's fine. Chill out” 

“CHILL?” he yelled. “I just got this goddamn piece of shit and now it's broken….already” He arose from his chair and walked towards the TV, his limp visibly hurting him. 

“I’m sure it's ju-” 

“It's broken” he cut me off, his usual pissy attitude proclaiming his tone. He lifted his right arm, and swung it at the TV. I watched, frightened, as the screen flickered and cracked, from the might of his punch. 

“MAZE WHAT THE FUCK!” He turned his gaze towards me, his mouth sneering. We stood there, staring at each other in silence, when the screen came to life to show a video of a house. White siding, blue boards, and an old white door. It looked familiar to me, I've seen it before. 

“Aaron, isn’t that your house?” It.. It was. The lights were on, but something was on the windows, smeared across. On the lawn, it appeared a figure of a dog was laying down. 

“Aaron, answer me,” he said nervously. I didn't have a chance to respond before the channel flipped to a video of the house I was standing in, I could see my shadow in the downstairs window. It was Maze’s house. 

A thundering bang came from the direction of the front door.
