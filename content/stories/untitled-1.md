You came into this world unexpectedly, 

But loved

And nothing ever could change it

When I first saw your face,

Your 10 tiny fingers,

And 10 tiny toes,

I was overjoyed.

I was a father,

To a beautiful baby girl.

Your eyes were amber, 

Hair a mahogany brown, 

Although so little and fragile,

You changed my world

Our world

I can only hope that when my final days arrive,

You find this journal, 

And realise, 

Just how much we loved you. 

Although your inner demons fought against you, 

Belittled you, 

You continued on in this so called path of life

And your mother and I couldn’t be more proud.

Our end might be coming, 

But your life is just beginning.
