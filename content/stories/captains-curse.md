Morgan was right.

He taught me what it means to 

Sink into the 

    warm, 

        Thick,

            Allure 

of his Captain's embrace.

&nbsp;&nbsp;
Happiness lies deep -

Buried beneath his dark ocean.

&nbsp;&nbsp;
My lungs deflate -

    Drifting down

        And down.

Until I'm staring back 

into the empty glass.

&nbsp;&nbsp;
But theres a hole at the bottom 

Of every Captain’s curse.
